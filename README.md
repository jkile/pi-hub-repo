# pi-hub-repo

A truly fullstack web development project by the Underwater-Squad. 

The goal of this project is to create a custom github clone hosted locally on private hardware.

Our minimally viable product will be to have a site with authentication where, when a user logs in, said user will be able to see and browse project files that they have uploaded. This project will allow users on the local network to push to their project on our database using git, or upload via their browser on our site. There will be no support for remote pushing at launch. We will have this website visible and accesible on the web, though the mechanism to do this has not yet been decided (there are several logistical factors at play).

The major technologies and packages we are using as of right now are:
HTML, CSS/Tailwind, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, bcrypt, jwt.
